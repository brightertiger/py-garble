1. BRANCH PROTECTION SETUP
================================================================================

This guide explains how to set up branch protection rules to ensure all tests 
pass before allowing merges to the main branch.

OVERVIEW
--------
The `ci.yml` workflow runs comprehensive tests on every push and pull request, 
including:
- Test Suite: All 44 tests across 5 test files
- Linting: Code style and quality checks
- Type Checking: Static type analysis
- Package Building: Ensures the package can be built successfully

SETTING UP BRANCH PROTECTION
----------------------------

Step 1: Navigate to Repository Settings
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on Settings tab
3. Click on Branches in the left sidebar

Step 2: Add Branch Protection Rule
1. Click Add rule or Add branch protection rule
2. In the Branch name pattern field, enter: main (or master if that's your default branch)

Step 3: Configure Protection Settings
Enable the following options:

✅ Require a pull request before merging
- Check this box
- Optionally check "Require approvals" and set to 1 or more reviewers

✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
- Check this box
- Check "Require branches to be up to date before merging"
- In the search box, add these required status checks:
  - test (3.8)
  - test (3.9)
  - test (3.10)
  - test (3.11)
  - test (3.12)
  - lint
  - build

✅ Require conversation resolution before merging
- Check this box to ensure all comments are resolved

✅ Restrict pushes that create files
- Check this box to prevent direct pushes

Step 4: Additional Options (Recommended)
✅ Include administrators
- Check this box to apply rules to repository admins too

✅ Allow force pushes
- Leave unchecked to prevent force pushes

✅ Allow deletions
- Leave unchecked to prevent branch deletion

Step 5: Save the Rule
Click Create or Save changes to apply the branch protection rule.

WHAT THIS ACHIEVES

when versions are released.

OVERVIEW
--------
The documentation deployment system automatically builds and publishes Sphinx docs
to GitHub Pages whenever:
- Code is pushed to the main branch
- A new release is published
- Manual deployment is triggered

This ensures documentation is always up-to-date and versioned appropriately.

WORKFLOWS

Triggers:
- Push to main branch
- Pull requests to main branch
- Release publication

Features:
- Builds Sphinx documentation
- Validates documentation structure
- Deploys to GitHub Pages (main branch only)
- Uses Read the Docs theme

2. Release Documentation (.github/workflows/release-docs.yml)
Triggers:
- Release publication

Features:
- Updates documentation version automatically
- Creates versioned documentation
- Deploys version-specific docs
- Maintains documentation history

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
------------------

1. Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click "Settings" tab

5. Review package contents before publishing

REPOSITORY SECURITY
-------------------
1. Use branch protection rules
2. Require pull request reviews
3. Enable status checks
4. Restrict direct pushes to main branch
5. Include administrators in protection rules

PUBLISHING SECURITY
-------------------
1. Use API tokens with minimal required permissions
2. Test packages on Test PyPI first
3. Verify package contents before publishing
4. Monitor for unauthorized access
5. Keep dependencies up to date
